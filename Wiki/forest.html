  <div class="Guts">
  <h2 class="Pg">Surviving in Forests</h2>
  <p class="pg">Forests are in my opinion the easiest place to survive, because they have an abundance of resources.
     Don't be mistaken surviving any where is dangerous and you should always be carefully no matter what.</p>
  <h2 class="Pg">Pros of Forests</h2>
  <p class="pg">Like I said there is an abundance of resources in forest such as wood. Your probably thinking "no wwwaaaayyy there is wood in the forest"
     well for the smart alecks every where the uses of said wood can be broken down into 5 of categories such as Fire wood, shelter material, 
	 post material, tool material, and Crap. Shelter, post, and tool meterials can be found in the Construction page. 
	 Fire wood can be broken in to 3 categories logs, planks, kindling. kindling is what you use to start a fire </p>
