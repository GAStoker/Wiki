	<p class="pg">The definition of survival is:"The state or fact of continuing to live or exist,
	typically in spite of an accident, ordeal, or difficult circumstances." There is many 
	ways to survive each situation is different and	every choice is the difference between
	life and death. Everything you do effects your physical health well being and more important your mental health.
	Your most important tool is your mind without it you can not survive.</p>

      <p class="pg">I have created different Pages for you to research located in the left side bar on various topics more will be add as 
	  things pop in to my mind.I hope what you read adds to your knowledge. There is no greater gift then knowledge and it is essential for survival.
	  A man that knows how to survive can survive with the shirt on his back, but a man who has not learned how to survive can have 
	  all the tools in the world the fanciest gear ever and die in the bush. It is better to learn now then later for there is no crueler and an 
	  unforgiving teacher then failure.</p>

	   about dum stuff if you do complain about it I'll put it in antialphabetical order or as it's commonly called 'lacitebahplaitna redro'.
